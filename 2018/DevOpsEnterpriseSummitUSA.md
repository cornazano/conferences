**Livetweet contents**

> "One of my crazy dreams is to kill a legacy system" - @chawklady #DOES18

> "Negative ROI is real" - @annebradley #DOES18


**Other notes**

* Fine for being found in violation of GDPR: 4% of global annual revenue.

* Notion of MVC: Minimum Viable Compliance

* Working to secure personal data, deleted 1/2 petabyte of data that wasn't necessary. This means they don't need to protect it!

* Moving to a multiregion strategy. This is more than just moving things (not just theater).

**Video segments**

* [Collision between product and project work (2:08)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgf_D2DUlJ0?start=1327&end=1454)


**Livetweet contents**

> For "new top priority": move from "no" to "yes and here's your tradeoffs" based on making all work visible on a wall. @ScottPrugh Brian Clark #DOES18

> "Queues and projects don't learn. Product based teams do." - @ScottPrugh #DOES18


**Other notes**

* Mentioned swarming for handling support - need to better understand this.

* Should manage product value streams, not projects.

* Operations is an engineering and product problem (not something independent).

* Developed a service catalog, now contains over 620 services.

* To make work visible, they have a TAP room. All work is color coded on the (manual!) wall, only work on what's on the wall.

* This enabled moving from replying "no" to "yes, and here's your tradeoffs".

* Work management is unified in a single system; ongoing improvement efforts are integrated into the service.

**Livetweet contents**

> Periods of disruption are (also) periods of opportunity. - @jsnover #DOES18

> "Just because you've been doing great doesn't mean you're going to continue doing great." #DOES18

> Do you want to be relevant? Not enough to be excellent at something, especially if you're excellent at something that no longer matters. #DOES18


**Other notes**

* Digital was excellent at something that no longer mattered!

* Inflection point for transitions (go check slides).

* Two axes:
  * Mission Critical (failure --> deep trouble) / Enabling (everything else)
  * Core (differentiators) / Context (everything else)

* Core + Mission Critical makes $$$

* Context + Mission Critical is risk

* Shift work to sent the bulk of the IT buget to core work.

* Build what differentiates you, buy what doesn't.

* Automation is key to creating bandwidth.

**Livetweet contents**

> Lesson: Find ways to make change without top-down edicts. - @yesthattom #DOES18

> Service hygiene ratings can work if we use scores to determine which services need more resources - not for judging people. #DOES18

> You want your best people to _want_ to move to the teams that are struggling. Look at your incentives to get there. #DOES18

> Four-point scale developed by the team - including one for something to model on. [IMAGE]

> They implemented a rate limit for investment in paying down technical debt. [Reminds me of work leveling in lean management.] #DOES18


**Other notes**

* Hygiene assessment was for data gathering, NOT project mgmt / evaluation.

* Rollup for management is for determining which services need more resources, judging the service and NOT the people.

* Culture - we want to FIX things, not hide them.

**Livetweet contents**

> Problems that a product mindset should help to address. -- Kevin Fisher #DOES18 [Number 2 really speaks ot me.] [IMAGE]

> Project pipeline: only 2.5% of time was spent in development. #DOES18

> Product modeling is about getting to a point where you can measure your flow. -- @nicolebryan #DOES18

> Key to this is to determine which artifacts matter; this allows product modeling. #DOES18

> You need to get tools talking to one another in order to really manage the product model. #DOES18


**Other notes**

* How do we do long term planning? We don't actually (sense and respond).

* Continuous Compliance - manage risk continuously.

* Shifted to hypothesis=based funding.

* Business vs. IT perspective: 1 product was represented by...
  * 7 artifact types, stored in
  * 6 different tools, managed as
  * 10 projects (JIRA etc.), owned by
  * 8 teams

**Livetweet contents**

> B2B shift: from selling complex products to IT departments to selling outcome services to the business users. -- Laura Fay #DOES18

> This shifts where complexity is handled - vendors take on more of the complexity management. #DOES18

> Wow. 80% of companies in the XaaS space are not profitable today. -- Laura Fay #DOES18

> Product managers are increasingly reporting to CEO or business unit GMs. This reflects a notion of the PM as the CEO of the Product. #DOES18

> Some key factors in seeking XaaS profitability: #DOES18 [IMAGE]

> A key question becomes "how can we work together to accelerate time to profitable revenue?" #DOES18


**Other notes**

* 72% of Splunk's revenue went into marketing.

* Shift from code-to-cloud to idea-to-customer-use.

**Livetweet contents**

> Observed a spike, in Sweden, in diagnoses of Severe Clinical Depression - Work Related Only among IT professionals. -- Christina Maslach #DOES18

> "Short-term 'start-up' self-sacrifice is now a long term model." :( #DOES18

> There are no metrics for the human costs of this culture. [If we can't measure it, how can we improve it?] #DOES18

> Factors related to burnout (called out as the image she hopes we remember): [IMAGE]

> Formulation as mismatches can help us identify how to address issues. Greater mismatch increases risk of burnout. #DOES18

> Burnout is a stress phenomenon; it is a prolonged response to chronic situational stressors. #DOES18

> MBI (Measure of Burnout) is an assessment to help identify and characterize different elements of burnout, gives a profile of work circumstances. This gives a profile to help diagnose how people are doing and how we can intervene.  #DOES18

> Burnout is a warning sign of a toxic environment. Hint: Don't try to heal the canary in the coalmine, address the environment. #DOES18

> Need to shift from "fitting people to the job" to "fitting the job to people". #DOES18

> Core needs for job fit: autonomy, belongingness, competence, positive emotions, psychological safety, fairness, and meaning. #DOES18

> Changes in our work environments can make a (significant) difference in the experience of workers. #DOES18 [IMAGE]

**Livetweet contents**

> @mik_kersten discussing project to product transition. #DOES18

> A first key realization was that fragmented value streams kill personal productivity. #DOES18

> Second epiphany: silos and proxy metrics destroy transformations (and adaptation to changing contexts). #DOES18

> A project management layer between business and IT is a silo. This layer got in the way of a transformation. Realization three: Project management and cost centers are the wrong model. #DOES18

> Technology diffusion model across technological revolutions shows a common pattern, with a turning point from an installation period to a deployment period. We're at this turning point now; the question becomes how do our organizations survive it? #DOES18

> Each technological revolution is accompanied by a change in our management models. #DOES18

> Comparison of car production and enterprise it. Car production embodies lean principles. #DOES18 [IMAGE]

> There are four things that flow in software work: Features, risks, defects, and debts. #DOES18

> The flow framework is intended to give us a common vocabulary between business leaders and IT. #DOES18

> Flow must be modeled at the value stream level, not at the team level. #DOES18

> To get away from proxy measures, we need to get to a point where we measure flow through the whole connected value stream network. #DOES18

> Need to stop bringing people to the work, bring work to the people. Give them autonomy, mastery, and purpose. #DOES18

> An unexpected consequence of focusing on more features (and taking on tech debt): reduced happiness. [IMAGE]

> If we're not doing continuous delivery in a regulated environment, then we're not compliant enough. -- @TopoPal Jamie Specter #DOES18

> Six years ago, Capital One said NO to open source. [They open sourced a project last year]. #DOES18

> First page of an open source approval form, that needed to be faxed. Determined that there needed to be a better way. #DOES18 [IMAGE]

> From a survey: 96% of applications contain open source; 57% of code base is open source. #DOES18

> Need to know what risks are associated with using open source. 4800 vulnerabilites reported in 2017, 134% increase in reported vulnerabilities per code base in 2018. #DOES18

> Implication: need to remediate, replace, or upgrade regularly. #DOES18

> Wow! Risks on legal side. There are over 2000 known open source licences. #DOES18

> Lawyer, at a bank, with a GitHub account, authoring a pull request. :) #DOES18

> Some worst case scenarios related to legal risks. These need to be thought about when using open source. #DOES18 [IMAGE]

> If you automate a bad process, you get a bad automated process. #DOES18

> Successfully argued for getting to contribute to open source projects. Four years of contributions, three years of their own projects being open sourced. #DOES18

> One of the primary benefits of their open source investment is the reinforcement of a culture of collaboration. #DOES18

**Livetweet contents**

> Next up: @levi_online @pmotch and @LukeRettig #DOES18

> To have great products, we need to have our customers at the table. #DOES18

> Guidance for technology governance should be accessible, transparent, flexible, and cultural. #DOES18

> Target used to have a centralized group that made all technology choices. Shifted to a list of recommended technology choices, housed in at git repo. Lists recommendations by tech type, with status (recommended, limited use, or do not use).  #DOES18

> The list is in git; anyone can open up a pull request to propose a change to the recommendations. #DOES18

> An interesting benefit from using git and pull requests: you can find the discussion related to the adoption of a specific recommendation, using the same tools we are already familiar with from managing our source code. #DOES18

> It's important to resist complexity in the process; developers need to be able to contribute, not something that's a burden and creates friction for contributions. #DOES18

> For big changes, the CIO and their direct reports have a quarterly opportunity for people to pitch the proposed change. This process demonstrates trust and confidence in the process, helping to build developer confidence and engagement. #DOES18

> Building the wrong thing is a nightmare. Contraining the engineers tends to lead to poorer results; giving them choices produces a better chance of success. #DOES18

> A perspective: A product manager is the voice of the consumer, but also needs to spend just as much time making sure the development team knows what you're building, who your building it for, and why you're building it. #DOES18

> As engineers, we need to make sure we get grounded in the what, why, and who of our work. #DOES18

> "Software is never done, it's just ready to be shipped." #DOES18

**Livetweet contents**

> Next: @damonedwards Operations: The Last Mile #DOES18

> Development has been moving in agile directions since 2001; the last ops wave was ITIL in 1989. "The last mile" is the question of how we get through the remainder of the delivery network. #DOES18

> LOL! During incident... "You get on the call, you run top, the top ten things are other people running top." #DOES18

> Tickets have a "context wagon" associated with them. Waiting, interruptions, and context switching contribute more stuff to the context wagon. #DOES18

> Heroics: sounds good, but is actually a problem. #DOES18

> Improvement conventional wisdom (better tools, more people, discipline and attention to detail, more reviews and approvals). We need to challenge this - we need to change the systemic issues. #DOES18

> Low trust is an issue. People making decisions following escalation are the people who have the least context to make informed decisions. #DOES18

> Excessive toil is an issue. We need to shift to work that builds enduring value (automate what can be so that we can apply human creativity to improving the business. #DOES18

> Silos are an issue. They cause contextual disconnects and mismatches. #DOES18

> Fourth force affecting this: Queues are an issue. They disintegrate and obscure value streams. #DOES18

> Netflix model (cross functional teams) compared to Google model (closer to traditional org structure). In the Google model, SRE is not a right. You have to prove that you're worthy of it. #DOES18

> Use tickets what they're good for: documenting problems, routing. We need to quit using ticket queues as a work management system! #DOES18

> Self service strategy: provides a point for integrating security, improves recovery time, and improves consistency and compliance. #DOES18

**Livetweet contents**

> Empathy is based on presuppositions and bias. The most important systemic element for change is not empathy - it is you, the decisions that you make, and the actions that you take. -- @paulycomtois #DOES18

> Transformation successes: succeded short term, but not long term. Teams would slide backwards once he moved on to the next team transformation. #DOES18

> Measures of success included increasing value without sacrificing value. [I like this as an expression of how to mitigate against unintended consequences.] #DOES18

> Business metrics are important, but we should take a more holistic approach to ensure that changes outlive us. #DOES18

> Articulating a framework for change, starting with you. You need to discover the culture, the person (not people!), and the value. #DOES18

> If you're not looking at how your process affects your downstream workcenters, you're missing an opportunity. #DOES18

> Three factors related to understanding a person: are *incentives* to a person aligned with their *drivers* - the things that motivate them? What are their *fears*? #DOES18

> Fears include loss of control, power, credibility, and identity. #DOES18

> While leading a transformational change, it's up to you to create a path forward for everyone: before, during, and after the change. #DOES18

> If you don't add value, you're just doing change for the sake of change. The difficulty is that we all perceive value in different ways. We have to find ways to bring views together and align them. #DOES18

> Authenticity is important for leading change. It's really hard to believe in and follow a leader that doesn't believe in the change they're leading. #DOES18

> Culture + strategy drive vision and authenticity; management + engineers drive uniquness and environments for change; leadership needs to move to a leader-leader model to make the difference in change efforts. #DOES18

**Livetweet contents**

> Next up: @dominicad Making Connections Visible #DOES18

> Business, like IT, has unplanned, invisible work with challenging handoffs where things get lost. #DOES18

> "Things take too long" is a univeral problem. To address it, we need a defragged value stream to improve flow - we need to find and fix broken handoffs. #DOES18

> Complexity drives necessary specialization; we need specialists to deal with esesential complexity of our software systems, and we need people in different specialties to succeed. #DOES18

> A primary care physician can't know everything about the human body; the same is true for software expertise (e.g. security). However, specialization drives fragmentation and cost in our work systems. #DOES18

> A key question: should IT be a cost center or a profit center? If we're a cost center, there is frequently no investment and no reason for people to stay. #DOES18

> The reality of teams using the tools they choose is that the tools don't talk to each other and we end up with a disconnected, fragmented value stream. The communication and handoffs are generally invisible and you can't see the dependencies. #DOES18

> "If I had a brain anyeurysm, I want the brain surgeon to use the brain surgeon tools." #DOES18

> Optimizing flow time requires visible connections, clear priorities, and metrics. #DOES18

> Idea: Put the communication mechanisms for handoffs on the work board. This helps us understand the flow of information. #DOES18

> Teams need to become mutually aware of each other in the value stream; part of this occurs by moving from just making work visible to making the connections visible. #DOES18

> Role play: you need to be resources, and exhibit some learned helplessness. #DOES18

> Antipattern roleplay CEO: "I wouldn't know, I've never done a gemba walk, I've never been to a workplace" "You're going to transform." #DOES18

> [I really hope this is recorded - the illustration of antipatterns is wonderful!] #DOES18

> Inflicting agile on people doesn't work. Key message: don't mandate one way of working, it is not the best approach. People and organizations are complex adaptive systems, there is no one size fits all solution in these contexts. #DOES18

> VOICE: Values and principles -- Outcomes and purpose -- Intent based leadership -- Coaching and support -- Experimentation #DOES18

> Experiments are non-reversible in complex adaptive systems (including our social systems). #DOES18

> Experiments feed back to values and outcomes as double-loop learning; this is how we adapt if we got it wrong (or even just not exactly right). #DOES18

> Very few leaders know the actual state of their system of work, how much is in progress. You have to know the health of your system of work, visualizing it can help. #DOES18

> Recommendation: start with a vertical slice when moving to experimental approaches (don't skip the middle of the managment chain). #DOES18

> Commander's intent statement (mission) is important for alignment, supported by nested cadences. #DOES18

> The locus of control must be internal, not imposed from outside. This is how teams are able to take on ownership. #DOES18

> Shu Ha Ri: Beginner, intermediate, and expert level need different coaching and supports in order to succeed and feel a sense of being in control. #DOES18

> The Toyota Coaching Kata gives middle managers a role and job to do as we move to agility. #DOES18 (@RealMikeRother )

> Advice: Start with the leadership team, start with a vertical slice, give people a VOICE, start small with and e2e view, and finally fan out sideways. #DOES18

**Other notes**

* Experiments follow a probe-sense-respond cycle. They are non-reversible in complex adaptive systems.

* Better - Incidents, Recovery
* Value - OKRs
* Sooner - Lead time, Flow metrics
* Safer - Control Compliance
* Happier - eNPS, cNPS (net promoter scores)

> Next up: @nicolefv and @jezhumble The Data Behind DevOps: Becoming a High Performer #DOES18

> Meaurement common mistake: lines of code leads to issues both when treating more is better and with less is better. #does18

> Common mistake: velocity. Don't use it to measure productivity or comparing people (it's a relative measure). #DOES18

> Utilization is only good up to a point. 100% utilization --> maximum lead times. Want to optimize for throughput, not utilization. #DOES18

> What we want to measure are outcomes, not output. Need multiple measures (if you only measure one thing, you know which measure will be gamed). #DOES18

> Speed and stability go together; there is no tradeoff. This is true in 5 years of data. #DOES18

> New outcome measure this year's survey: availability. Throughput and stability and availability move together, and predict better organizational outcomes. #DOES18

> "Maturity models are dumb." #DOES18

> What we actually need is to identify constraints and continuously improve, and manage the capabilities that predict performance. #DOES18

> Testing should not be a phase after coding is complete; we need to shift left on testing and integrate it into the development process. #DOES18

> Monitoring and observability load together - at the stats level, these are perceived as being the same thing. #DOES18

> Cloud infrastructure helps but only if you do it right. On demand self service; broad network access; resource pooling; rapid elasticity; measured service. #DOES18

> "You can't slap a sticker on your data center and call it the cloud." #DOES18

> Functional outsourcing does not work. The costs often far exceed the savings when calculating cost of delay. #DOES18

> If you cannot quickly and safely release changes, you can't respond to security vulnerabilities. #DOES18

> What can leaders do to influence outcomes? Give our teams autonomy. Contributes to voice (ability to speak out) and trust. These contribute to culture and, ultimately, outcomes. #DOES18

> Retrospectives predict climate for learning; they both predict the needed culture for high performance. #DOES18

> Change advisor boards are useless for approvals. Correlates *negatively* with performance. Need to move to governance rather than inspection. #DOES18

> First up for day 3: @cdavisafc Taking Ops & Infrastructure from Iterative to Functional, Just like Dev #DOES18

> History of computing trends to greater disribution and parallelization: single thread --> multi thread --> multi process --> distributed. Languages developed in time along with this, moving from imperative to functional as we move to distributed. #DOES18

> Imperative languages are inherently sequential, creating edge cases (source of bugs) and making parallelization difficult. Functional languages break things into subproblems rather than dealing with steps; easier parallelization, fewer bugs. #DOES18

> Intereting shifts as we move from imperative to functional programming: iterative to declarative, mutable to immutable, looping to recursive, libraries to aspect oriented programming. #DOES18

> There are related shifts moving from imperative to functional systems programming. #DOES18

> Declarative deployment is a declaration managed by a control loop, automating what we needed to hand write in imperative language tools. This is a bit like an inductive proof. #DOES18

> Pipeline using immutable objects for deployment is similar to creating new frames in functional programming call stacks. Each frame is immutable. #DOES18

> Sidecars allow us to inject cross-cutting concerns, like what we do in aspect-oriented programming. #DOES18

> To influence people, you need to understand what motivates them. -- Chris O'Malley #DOES18

> Compuware was able to get people to reset themselves, rather than having to change over the people involved in the organization. [ed: yes! we need to help people grow and develop] #DOES18

> Ideation: discussing MTTR and deployment rates is disconnected from the customer. Customer obsession and trying to understand them drives you to innovate on their behalf. Counterbalance metrics with relation to customer experience. #DOES18

> We need to become storytellers. Messaging is important to connect discussions of throughput, efficiency, and keeping us in a resilient state to the organization's future and their customer and board needs. #DOES18

> Survey: some employees are engaged; 50% are disengaged; and 17% will effectively sabotage the organization. 2/3 of the org will be the headwind we need to work against to accomplish change. What we need are passionate explorers. #DOES18

> We need to get things out of the backlog, and get to a point where we have deliverables that make a difference for the customers. [This should really affect how we express our objectives and work items.] #DOES18

> Being a leader is lonely, and it's scary. Getting change done is hard when dealing with the organizational headwinds that opose change. #DOES18

> I really like the perspective and experience shared in this fireside chat. Visibility into the exec level thought processes isn't something we get often enough. Thank you, @chris_t_omalley !

**Livetweet contents**

> Next up: @jpaulreed The Five Dirty Words of CI [Continuous Improvement] #DOES18

> Dirty Word 1: Root Cause Analysis. Perception is that issues are a series of dominos, but this is deceptively linear, and we tend to only look at the last point before the failure. It's just where we stop looking further. #DOES18

> Slightly better: proximate causes (but this still has limitations and tends to linearity). #DOES18

> Dirty word 2: Five Whys. Perception is that incidents are deterministic [and procedural; declarative/functional might not be the same]. Its inappropriate as a model for operational issues. #DOES18

> Dirty Word 3: Human Error. There are incentives and personal interests about where to draw the line, and stops investigation into how to improve the system. Human error needs to be the starting point of the investigation. #DOES18

> Taking this perspective, we can learn more about our systems - sometimes in huge ways (e.g., AWS adding input sanity checks to operational tools after an S3 outage). #DOES18

> Dirty Word 4: Counterfactuals (why didn't you...). You end up discussing a reality that doesn't exist instead of actually learning. #DOES18

> Dirty Word 5: Best practice. Implies that there is only one way without variation; in complex systems, it also ignores (necessary) context. It also shuts down innovation, discovery, and experimentation [therefore, also, learning]. #DOES18

> Worse - best practices only apply in a domain that we're not in (obvious / simple systems). We live in a complicated / complex system. "Good practice" is better, leaves options open. #DOES18

> Takeaways. Not a one-and-done thing. Respect reality. Treat people like professionals they are. #DOES18

> Next: @JonHall_ The Problem of Becoming a 3rd-Line Support Team (& why swarming works better for devops) #DOES18

> In classic tiered support, escalation occurs through the levels. But... issues spend time in L1 support when the answer is in L2 or L3; and it bounces around due to lack of context. It also encourages SMEs as heros. #DOES18

> Swarming is an approach to eliminate the tiers and be more responsive to customer support needs. Can be different types. #DOES18

> Severity 1 - rapid responders (1% of issues). Local dispatch swarms - watch issues, pick and fix things they can fix. Backlog swarm - needs help from other teams to quit bouncing issues around. #DOES18

> Tickets can now stay with an owner and bring in the right people. Note: swarming breaks traditional metrics! #DOES18

> Swarming improved both metrics (MTTR, customer satisfaction) and human outcomes (on-boarding time, freed up resources). #DOES18

> It can add challenges relative to classic support structure. Example: difficult to evaluate individual contribution (however, they actually work as a team, so the measurement was actually wrong!). #DOES18

> More practically: need guardrails to keep a few people from dominating, need to be able to find the right people. #DOES18

> "The enterprise space doesn't move slowly because they're stupid, or they hate technology. It's because they have users." #DOES18

> Nice! Relating the swarming model to the Cynefin domains! #DOES18

> Some functional programming principles: immutability; actions, not objects; and purity (avoid side effects). -- Scott Havens #DOES18

> Immutability: Communication is via messages (events), and state is an interpretation the events rather than a representation. Actions: The focus will be on verbs rather than nouns. Purity: Allows interchange of compute and data. #DOES18

> Commands, in this approach, are a strongly typed messages expressing an intent to change state. #DOES18

> The changed state is an event; these are the result of processing a command. This occurs via pure functions, and is provisional until committed to the event stream. #DOES18

> State is built via a zero state, apply (handles a single event), and fold (applies a sequence of events). [This feels like a partial sequence in mathematics, with each sequential state being the next term in the sequence.] #DOES18

> Storage for the event queue requires that each downstream consumer will see an event exactly once. #DOES18

> For resilience, design idempotent and commutative functions so that out-of-order handling and other recovery processes are (comparatively) easy. Requires moving forward for all changes. [This resonates with effects in complex adaptive systems.] #DOES18

> Interesting property: you can re-create the state as it existed at any time by processing the event queue. #DOES18

> Closing talk! @rzesz Breaking Bad Leadership: The Anti-Heroes of DevOps #DOES18

> Increasing complexity of our systems is a reflection of growing technical debt, especially in comparison to startups. #DOES18

> Problems are all contextual, tied to your actual conditions - but there are recurring themes that can provide inspiration. #DOES18

> What is your role? Make the bank better - not just within the part of the organization where he sits, federating out to support other parts of the bank. #DOES18

> A major element of this is to identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies and execute. #DOES18

> What got a leader into a position of leadership is what they know. Need to persuade them to change. #DOES18

> Operational personas we deal with and need to empathize with: the general (command and control), the boy scout (follows policy), and the skeptic (pushes against change). #DOES18

> You are the CEO of your own career: be a change agent, pursue continuous learning, adopt new mental models (paradigm shift). #DOES18

> We need to get comfortable with being uncomfortable and learn to accept ambiguity. This takes courage. #DOES18
