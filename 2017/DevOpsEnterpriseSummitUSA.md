</a>

* Security metrics in daily work - high performers (State of DevOps report)
* Devops is for both unicorns and horses
* We don't learn from what thinking about / actually learn from experiences (also, allows negating of "can't do it here" objections)
* Span business/tech divide - one of the types of experience reports

## <a name="prugh-morisson"></a> More Culture, More Engineering, Less Duct-Tape

</a>

* Build/run teams (collapsed dev + ops teams) - working on eliminating bimodal identity
* Mode 1: Servers are destroyed in the parking lot with a sledgehammer
* Mode 2: Servers apps run safely with speed + quality
* 60% reduction in incidents by changing to build/run teams (got rid of silos - made issues visible in devs experience!)
* CSG has an HR person here - because it is about the people!
* Service owner model
  * combine dev + ops backlogs!
  * Get the investment into fixing service issues - USE IT AS A FORCING FUNCTION!
  * Decentralized change model; make systems safer for change
  * Support - tiers are an issue, switch to Major Incident Swarm model
  * Moved from "blissfully unaware" to Post-Incident Review + After Action Summary
* Metric: how much sleep I get during these changes!
* Reorganized. What does DevOps mean to CSG? - Targetd DevOps culture focus.
* Looking to learn more about culture aspects.

## <a name="rzeszotarski-gillespie"></a> Augmenting the Org for DevOps

  width="40%"
/>
</a>

* Key Bank is the 13th largest in the US.
* Dev team - speed to market
* Sec - compliance
* Ops - reliability
* Network hops - hundreds - dependencies
* Shift from 24 to 18 months to handle largest post-2008-meltdown bank acquisition. Moved from waterfall to devops to do this.
* Moved to Kubernetes for reliability; containergeddon.
* Netflix Histerix framework for circuit breakers.
* Test automation - because it is a bottleneck (constraint in TOC terms); 20 hours --> 12 mins.
* Login was worse + confusing - social media fallout about how Key Bank screwed up.
* 10 changes in 4 business days, no impact, all during the business day.
* Confidence gap. Animosity between sides.
  * innovative change <--> control & reliability
  * advancement <--> complacency
* windows: start using keyboard
* linux: start using mouse
* metaphor of IT as air traffic control
* Grow a new talent base, **not** traditional application development
* Should automate infrequent tasks to avoid errors.
* Growing new

## <a name="nasello"></a> Using DevOps to Build Your Learning Organization

</a>

* No exec sponsor, no driver, moving from commercial off the shelf software
* Role as IT professionals is changing
* Swap primaries and alternates (owners/experts) - idea, but they weren't ready
* Can't have follow the orders + leader w/o technical knowledge. BOOM!
* Mentioned _Turn The Ship Around!_ (Marquet)
* Be / Know / Do model. Leaders must be seen as _learning_ and _going outside their comfort zone_
* From no version control (send copy of script to myself via email) to target 250 artifacts; actually over 500.
* Consistently asked for "where's your artifact?"
* Attempt to automate. Discovers divergence in practice!
* "Rockstars/builders/janitors" (citing Alice Goldfuss' Velocity conf talk)
* Chatops - sufficiently important that they threw a birthday party for their chatbot!
* Engineers solving problems in real time with partners!
* Riff on Dojo - bring the learning to the people

## <a name="mayner"></a> Transformational Leadership and DevOps

Steve Mayner

</a>

* Organizational change is hard and prone to failure
* Survey of existing literature (lit review) as part of doctoral work
* _Leading Change_, John P. Cotter
* Culture change: 19% success
* Ability to adapt and change is a core competency
* Confusion --> frustration --> anxiety --> fear --> resistance
* More peer reviewed research on Transformational Leadership than any other theory
* Cycle: Creativity --> Growth --> Authenticity --> Vision --> (back to beginning)
  * First two involve interaction with others
  * Latter two involve leader leading themselves
* Leader needs to create _environment_ to empower others (adaptive leadership)
* Correlates with _successful_ organizational change; more influence than any change methodology (leader behaviors)
* Behaviors are learnable
* Leadership and change case study
* Transformation leadership initiative
* "First time I felt like someone actually cared if I stayed here"
* Need repeatable / scalable model of what they did

## <a name="yeman-johnson"></a> What Legacy Government Organizations Need to Advance the State of DevOps

Robin Yeman (Lockheed Martin) | Suzette Johnson (Northrop Grumman)

</a>

* "Felt it was more risky to keep doing things the same way than to change"
* 10 agile teams entailed integration issues. Response: Start down CI path, teast early, test often.
* "The Make-It-Work team because that was their task"
* When you tackle part of the value stream, another part becomes the bottleneck
* Growth of agile in an org means need for infra to support it
* Center of excellence - auditable procedures
* Build guidance so people don't have to reinvent
* Training - starts with engineers, but also managers - and leadership!
* If only doing at grassroots level, don't always have the authority to make necessary changes
* Make it easier to adopt, most people will adopt
* Coaches help teams get up and running
* Training includes finance as well.
* CS curriculum today looks the same as it did 25 years ago
* Agile and (separate) DevOps community of practice - book clubs - everybody is learning as we go
* Employee happiness as metric. Questioned: "but why do we care?"
* Principles: Not just about software, but across the value stream.

## <a name="degrandis"></a> The Balanced Calendar: How to Optimize Your Time

Dominica DeGrandis

  alt="The Balanced Calendar video. (31:24)"
  width="40%"
/>
</a>

* Too many meetings / interruptions lead to burnout
* 30-minute jam - problem is context switching, typical of managers.
* All day cram - no room for ataptation, typical of execs - need reschedule / cancelled
* Triple booked wham - rework costs
* "Knowledge work is perishable; the longer the time, the bigger the problem"
* Maker calendar - creative people - long blocks
* Manager calendar - decision makers - managers meet with managers during prime maker hours; include unstructured time!
* Combo calendar - people who do both - reschedule to free blocks for deliverables
* Interruption busters:
  * Pomodoro - short, high focus
  * Do not disturb hours - communicate and have _regular cadence_
  * Office hours
* How to get buy in. Measure competing metrics! How fast? productive? good? predicatble?
* "It's hard to manage unplanned work"
* "What's the probability of completing this work in X days?" - percentiles
* Set _ranges_ not _dates_
* _Death By Meeting_, Lencioni
* _250 Ways to Say No_

## <a name="knight"></a> How Systems Thinking and Lean Principles Can Be Used

  alt="How Systems Thinking and Lean Principles Can Be Used video. (27:59)"
  width="40%"
/>
</a>

* Cover top points
* Relevance? To fix the system, you need to look at flow
* work intake ---> code in production
* Implemented tools, not succeeding
* Systems thinking:
  * set of elements, inputs through phased transition --> emergence of an output
  * _not_ as system if no relationships
  * It's about feedback loops
* Lean principles:
  * Identify value
  * Map the value stream
  * etc.
* Refs: _Lean Thinking_, _The Machine That Changed The World_
* Theory of constraints:
  * This is what to fix to improve velocity
  * DevOps is _WHOLE SYSTEM_
* Claim: Value stream ignores feedback loops, need systems thinking [ed: complements kaizen, which at least partially accounts for feedback?]
* Integration hub

</a>

* What happens to ops with the crunch of change?
* Unplanned work - most toxic
* Ops - only place where planned + unplanned work come together
* "Dumpster diving looking for the right docs"
* Use lean thinking to look at post-deployment process
* Empower those closes to the issue
  * push left
  * escalation is counter to this
* Silo is a **WAY OF WORKING**, **NOT** just an org structure
* Look for ticket systems; they tend to have silos on either side!
* _Principles of Product Development Flow_: If you're going to measure one thing, measure cost of delay.
* Communication across cross-functional teams just re-silos
* Service design pattern: get rid of tickets as governing day-to-day work, use only for exceptions.
* Governance: Security and compliance stays within ops, move the rest left
* Support at the edge program: 47 mins reduced to 3.5, 50% reduction in escalations

</a>

* Government sector
* Different audiences, different skills; T-shaped skills, how to lead a DevOps team
* Does your team go through the class and _bring it home_?
* CSRA learning cohort
  * 1hr hw, 1 hr discussion per week
  * voluntary
  * scrummasters, team leads, pms - leads only
* Asked people to go deeper than what was learned in class
* Chatter group (slack) for cross-team discussion
* Repeat every quarter - 75 people for 12 weeks, _then they lead others_
* Adopting visual management system
* Want people to learn to be a devops team --> hackathon
* Cyberstorm. 1 day event; like a hackathon, red team/blue team, but for security. Keep your systems up, take their systems down.
* Training people before hiring! Partnered with universities, worked with them to modify programs to help ensure
* they were teaching transistors in comp sci, teaching C++ <-- not the highest impact skills
* created a devops degree, including systems thinking
* contrast: CS majors hired, had never used source control ;_;
* Talent pipeline - when hired, work with specific _type_ of senior
* Learn by doing - make learning as close to the job as possible
* CEO/CIO leadership recognition for obtaining new skills
* How to avoid group think and keep innovating?

## <a name="hering"></a> A Story of DevOps Transformations

  alt="A Story of DevOps Transformations video. (30:20)"
  width="40%"
/>
</a>

* _What Got You Here Won't Get You There_
* Metamodel - transformation lifecycle
* "There is no end state. If you think there's an end state, you're dreaming."
* Still working with management principles from early 20th century
* You can't successfully measure productivity in IT.
* Issue - false assumptions: IT can be managed based on engineering/manufacturing principles.
* Wrong mental model pushes us into adding more processes, which is a problem.
* Need to bring people together up front to talk about the business problems we're trying to solve.
* Cost reduction per hour likely indcates a lack of automation on the vendor side.
* first-time resolution time / resolution time; this ration should be high
* Partner or vendor - if vendor (mental model), can't fail entails can't learn (paid $, wants results)
